        <h2>Event Description: Treasure Hunt by Mathletes Club</h2>
        <p>The Mathletes Club organized an engaging and intellectually stimulating event called <strong>Treasure Hunt</strong>. This event was designed to combine problem-solving skills with teamwork and a sense of adventure. Here's how it unfolded:</p>
        <p><strong>Team Formation:</strong><br>
        Participants were grouped into teams of 5 members each. Teamwork and collaboration were key to succeeding in this event.</p>
        <p><strong>Solving Questions:</strong><br>
        Each team was presented with a series of challenging mathematical and logical questions. Successfully solving these questions was the gateway to advancing in the treasure hunt.</p>
        <p><strong>Location Puzzle:</strong><br>
        For every question solved, the team earned a slip revealing a location. However, the twist was that the location was given in the form of a puzzle. Teams had to decipher the puzzle to identify the next location.</p>
        <p><strong>Hunting the Treasures:</strong><br>
        At each location, unique shapes were hidden. Teams had to find these shapes as evidence of their success in decoding the puzzle.</p>
        <p><strong>Winning Criteria:</strong><br>
        The team that found the most locations and collected the highest number of shapes within the given time frame was declared the winner.</p>
        <p>This exciting event tested participants' analytical thinking, problem-solving abilities, and collaborative skills, making it a memorable and fun-filled experience for all. The blend of mathematics and adventure truly embodied the spirit of the Mathletes Club!</p>
